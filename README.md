## Project Description
Source: [Trump's Tweet Archives](http://www.trumptwitterarchive.com/)
This dataset contains a list of Donald Trump's 1000+ Tweets, including categorization and word count.
Our plan is to use these word counts to make a wordmap and create an interaction where clicking a word grants you the wordmap for the possible words that come after the word you selected.

## How We Aim to Make This Data Alive
## D3 Feature Utilization
## Sketch-up of Envisioned Visualization
